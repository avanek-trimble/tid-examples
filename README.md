The Angular app was created with Node.js 18.16.0, Angular 16, and Angular CLI 16. Follow Angular's [setup instructions](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) page to download the necessary programs and libraries to work with an Angular 16 application. After getting the tools installed, you can view the website by running `ng serve --open` on the command line in the Angular project folder.

The Blazor app was created with the [Blazor Web Assembly template](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new-sdk-templates#blazorwasm) and .NET 6. With the [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) installed, you can use the [dotnet commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet) `restore`, `build`, and `run` in the Blazor folder to pull down project dependencies, compile the project, and run the website. Or, you can use Visual Studio to load the `Blazor.sln` file.
